  <h1>Meteor Mogul</h1>
  <p>meteor-mogul is a hobby project for learning meteor, VueJS and Bootstrap to
     create apps for friends and family.</p>

  <p>The goal of the project (at this point) is just to make it easier for new developers
     to test out writing apps using VueJS with meteor.</p>

  <p>There are four major front-end frameworks that can work with meteor:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Blaze</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
    <li>VueJS</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Of these four, VueJS is the easiest to learn and has the most momentum going
     for it among hobbyists.  Unfortunately, it can be a bit tricky to get working
     in meteor since it is not part of the official build.</p>

  <p>That's where meteor-mogul comes in.  You can clone our simple sample apps and
     quickly see what it's like to develop an app using VueJS with meteor.</p>

  <h2>Current Status of meteor-mogul: Alpha</h2>

  <p>Two simple sample apps are working:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/meteor-mogul/mogul-helloworld">https://github.com/meteor-mogul/mogul-helloworld</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/meteor-mogul/mogul-meteor-vue-todo">https://github.com/meteor-mogul/mogul-meteor-vue-todo</a></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>A preliminary note:<br />
     If you have Windows 10, you'll probably notice when you start playing
     with meteor that everything comes to a grinding halt unless you turn off
     Windows Defender real-time scanning.  I don't want to recommend doing that,
     just putting it out there.</p>

  <p>If you can score a Mac to develop on, your time invested will be more
     rewarding.  Once you've developed an app, you can run it from a Windows
     desktop no problems.  It's just that the development toolchain is way
     better on a Mac.</p>

  <p>To start playing with meteor-mogul, here's what you need:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Either MacOS (easier and faster for developing with meteor-mogul) or
        Windows 10 (harder and slower for developing with meteor-mogul).</li>
    <li>A modern web browser. I recommend Google Chrome.</li>
    <li>A programming editor. I recommend Atom.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> or git.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once you have all the above, you'll need to practice a little bit to know
     how to use them.  Then the following instructions will make sense.</p>

  <p>Here's how to try out our simple sample apps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Clone the app you want to try, e.g. $ git clone https://github.com/meteor-mogul/mogul-meteor-vue-todo.git target-dir</li>
    <li>$ cd target-dir</li>
    <li>$ meteor npm install</li>
    <li>$ meteor</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you forget the "meteor npm install" you'll probably see error
     messages letting you know that you need to install the "babel-runtime" node
     package.  The "meteor npm install" just has to happen once, but it's okay
     to run it multiple times.</p>

  <h2>Under the Hood</h2>

  <p>The main thing meteor-mogul does is provide the latest version of VueJS as
     a meteor package and removes the blaze package.  So then when you write your
     .html files, vue.js takes over and deals with them instead.</p>

  <p>There are other projects which are aiming for a more robust integration of
     VueJS with meteor.  Those other projects allow you to write both blaze and
     vue templates.</p>

  <p>The ambition of meteor-mogul is more modest: it's here just to help you
     quickly get writing apps that use VueJS as the front-end and can use
     MongoDB and the other things on the back end that meteor provides.</p>

  <p>Any meteor package that needs blaze to run (and that's most of them that
     have a client interface) won't work with meteor-mogul.</p>

  <p>In the future I may try re-writing some of the most useful meteor packages
     (such as the accounts system) to work with VueJS.</p>

  <p>Have fun and I hope this saves you some time if you're interested in seeing
     what it's like to develop apps with VueJS and meteor together.</p>
