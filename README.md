# Meteor Mogul

Meteor Mogul is a hobby project for learning Meteor, VueJS and Vuetify to create apps for friends and family.

The basic plan is

1. Learn how to write apps with Meteor and VueJS by building a suite of simple apps.
2. Share with the world on GitHub.
3. After reaching a critical mass of code and knowledge, announce on a forum.
4. See where it goes from there.
